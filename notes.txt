Atomic ?? what does that mean
- there is one 
- base level 
- simplest 

Atomic counter .. 

class MyNumber {

	int number = 0;
	
	int increment(int by) {
		number = number + by;
	}
	
	int getNumber() {
		return this.number;
	}

}
















Race between the tortoise and the hare.

hare is fast but arrogant
tortoise is slow but persistent

- hare get's far ahead - and takes a nap before finishing
- by the time he wakes up
- the tortoise is too far ahead
- the hare runs as fast as he can 
- but the tortoise wins the race

race -----------------------------------------------------------|
       \--tortoise------------------------------------WAKE UP!--/
       \--hare-------------------------NAP----------------------/

how may can I have? 
- no real limit - you can have 1000's 

- how many should I have? 
	- depends on the runtime environment - how many CPU's??
	- if that is not clear - keep below 20
	
	
	20 threads but only 1 CPU core
		- what happens 
		CPU -> context switching  
			-> run some part of a thread - then 'switch' to another
			-> context switching - requires memory to be moved 
				-> expensive/slow
		



















 - Application
 	- Controller 
 		- Service 
 			- Service B 
 				- Client (HTTP)
 					- Library 
 						- Library Component 
 							- Throws error / has error

 If you had to write code to pass errors up to the Controller
 - that would be a lot of work
 - error prone 


 						<- pass the error back
 					<- Library pass the error back
 				<- Client pass the error back
 			<- Service B pass the error back
 		<- Service pass the error back 
 	<- Controller - shows the error to the customer

 - Application
 	- Controller 
 		- Service 
 			- Service B 
 				- Client (HTTP)
 					- Library 
 						- Library Component 
 							- Throws error / has error
 							- throw new Exception("Unable to parse BLA-12") -> Thread stops here and jumps to the next 'relevant' try block -> catch clause

 	Controller:
 		try {
	 		try {
	 			Service.call()
	 		} catch (Exception) {
		 		// AA
	 		}
 		} catch (Exception e) {

Polymorphism - Java??

Ability for objects to take different forms 
 - compile-time
 	- overloading
 - runtime 
 	- dynamic method
 	- closures 



Why is the point? 
 - readable --- handle difficult things better
 	- understandable? 
 - code re-use 
 - flexibility 
 - objects .. are a way of grouping like things 
 - categorize .. taxonomy/categories .. not perfect 
 - pragmatic .. efficient .. need flexibility 
 
 account for anything that doesn't match existing taxonomy
 - also - DRY - (Don't repeat yourself)
 	- less code
 	- generalizing
 	
 
 	













String message = "Hi merry, santa.2007@northpole.io Christmas eve!";

Pattern.compile("[\s]+[^\s]+@[^\s]{2,253}.[a-b]{2,55}");

[\s]+[^\s]+@[^\s]{2,253}.[a-b]{2,55}

^ - start of string
$ - end of string

-- pattern
[0-9a-zU.*] match one character of for example, 5 or t or U or . or *
-- special character within []
^ - NOT

-- Quantifiers
[somestuff]+          // 1 or more
[somestuff]?          // 0 or 1
[somestuff]*          // 0 or more
[somestuff]{3}        // needs to be 3

I WAS NOT CORRECT - [somestuff]{3-5}      // doesn't work -- sorry
I WAS NOT CORRECT - [somestuff]{3,5}      // needs to be 3 or 5 <- range
